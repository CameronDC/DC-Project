# DC-Project

The Scene...You arrive in a museum, with offices and rooms surrounding. You have a priceless stolen artifact in your hand and your 
fingerprints are everywhere! You need to get out, without being caught. The night guards are armed and constantly patrolling the building.

How the game works: if you get caught you must restart from that room you were in.  However the rest of the level resets and all your previous collected items are lost.

If you get shot: Same as before and you escape.  Game ends. All scores saved.

BONUS MISSIONS: 

1. no deaths = +1000 points
2. no shooting = +2000 points 
3. Die 100 times = +1 points
4. Don't use any diagonal moves = +1000 points 
5. spend 10+ minutes on 1 attempt = +500 points 

Highscores are saved in HIGH SCORES folder in the repository.
